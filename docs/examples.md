# Self-Contained Demonstration

We provide a self-contained demonstration that does **not** require any database access. This makes it easy to explore and test the framework without setting up a database connection.

The demonstration runs in **Google Colab** and uses the `data.parquet` file located in the `examples` directory of the repository.

You can open and run the notebooks directly via the following links:
