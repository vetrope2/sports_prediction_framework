# Getting Started

Welcome to the framework! There are two main ways to get started depending on your setup and needs:

## 1. Connect to a Database

If you want to work with your own or a remote database, make sure to configure your environment by creating a `.env` file in your current working directory. This file should include your database credentials and, if necessary, SSH tunnel settings.

> See [Database Configuration](database_connect.md) for detailed instructions.

## 2. Use the Self-Contained Examples

If you prefer a quick start without needing database access, you can explore our self-contained demonstrations. These run in Google Colab and use the sample data provided in the `examples` directory (`data.parquet`).

> Check out the [Examples and Demos](examples.md) page to open the notebooks directly.

Feel free to choose the option that best fits your workflow. If youâ€™re new, we recommend starting with the examples for a smooth introduction!
